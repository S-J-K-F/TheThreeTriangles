# Description: 
- The Three Triangles is a hybrid between a puzzle game and an RPG. You play as a child who has to journey through the whimsy of his dreams, the horror of his nightmares, and the curious in-between to collect three triangle-shaped objects. Conquer enemies and a multitude of puzzles alike, and enjoy the luxiorious artsytle curated by both the internet and yours truly. Boggle your mind in the dozen or so rooms this game has to offer; don't get to comfortable though, you never know what might be lurking in the darkness, or behind that looming door awaiting you at the end... Move up, down, right, or left, using the respective arrow keys. 

# Instructions (How to test each of the chosen features and where to find the related scenes and scripts for each feature):
- Movement and Collisions: Walk around, hold shift, and run into walls

- Enemies and Traps: Continue through the game and find the enemies/traps along the way

- Tilemaps and Worldbuilding: Each scene with the word "room" in it should have tilemap. Notice the worldbuilding is inside a person's dream.

- Dialogue: Talk to every NPC in the safe rooms, starting room, and final room to get the good ending. Do the opposite to get the bad ending.

- GUI (Health, action bar, pause menu, inventory, and dialogue selection): Look at the top left to see three hearts. The bottom corners should have the action bars. A silloute of a triangle acts as your inventory for how many triangles you have collected. Dialogue should be able to be selected and can go through. Presing ESC should pause the game.
