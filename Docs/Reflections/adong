### Sprint 1: Worked on setting up the title screen and directing it to the first scene

### Sprint 2: Fixed errors in titlescreen, main scene was in wrong file

### Sprint 3: Helped with dream rooms

### Sprint 4: Started with enemies and traps

### Final Thoughts: The project went on pretty smoothly except maybe the work distribution could've been a little more planned out. There was a few problems with the rooms and commits showing up at first.
