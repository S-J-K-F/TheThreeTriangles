### Sprint 1: During Sprint 1, I started to add tile maps into the game and collision to the tile maps. 

### Sprint 2: I created the dream rooms. There was a lot of trouble with one of the dream room tile maps that was causing a bunch of errors. 

### Sprint 3:
I was still working on the dream rooms and all the errors with it. 
### Sprint 4:
I started making an UI for the triangles collected.
### Final Thoughts:
Overall, I thought this project was hard because of all the challenges we faced.
