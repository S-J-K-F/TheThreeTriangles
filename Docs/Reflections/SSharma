### Sprint 1:
During this Sprite I worked on The end Screen and was about to start the Standard/Normal/Medium rooms.
### Sprint 2:
Sprite 2 was where I started to design the medium rooms and was gonna start the three roooms needed for this project.
### Sprint 3:
In Sprite 3 I was on my last medium room and was told to work on the Boss 
### Sprint 4:
During this sprite I had some issues making the boss which was passed onto one of the other group members, after countering that issue I faced another one, myy standard rooms had dissapered and was about to start over. Later on 
I got my rooms back and just added some details.
### Final Thoughts:

Overall I found this project pretty hard because of the transition from such basic projects only have 2 months to only to learn a new tool that probably none of us have ever heard about, but besides the point it was pretty hard.
